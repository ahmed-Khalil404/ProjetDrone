# LS-Safe

Welcome to LS-Safe, an IoT project integrating a drone with a smart belt for emergency interventions during cardiac crises or accidents.

## Overview

LS-Safe is designed to detect critical health events using a smart belt equipped with sensors. When a health crisis is detected, a drone is deployed automatically to the location, enabling rapid response and potential life-saving interventions.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors vital signs.
- **Immediate Response**: Drone deployment upon detecting emergency signals.
- **Remote Communication**: Two-way communication with emergency services.
- **Location Tracking**: GPS-enabled tracking for precise location identification.

## Usage

1. Ensure the smart belt and drone are properly configured and connected.
2. Activate the smart belt for continuous monitoring.
3. In case of an emergency, the drone will be automatically deployed to the location.
4. Use the remote communication feature to coordinate with emergency services.
